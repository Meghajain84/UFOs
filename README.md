# Overview of Project: 
The purpose is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. We have been given the data in data.js file.

# Results: 
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

# Summary: 
## Drawback of this new design:
It doesn't let the user fill input for their choice of search criteria in one go. Unnecessaily system resources are wasted to fetch rows whenever an input is put in a search criteria.

## Two recommendations:
* Use javascript to validate the input like date should be in certain format, and city, state, country and shape should only have alphabets. If not the user should be prompted to renter in required format.

* Another search criteria could be added based on duration.
